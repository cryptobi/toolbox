Preparing for Multiple Cryptocurrencies
---------------------------------------

In the future there'll be one model implementation for each supported cryptocurrency.

The classes under model/ will become interfaces and each implementation refactored into
their own cryptocurrency/ subfolder.

For now the classes under model/ implement Bitcoin Core directly. This indirection will later
become useful when supporting multiple cryptos.

Therefore this folder was intentionally left empty - for now.
